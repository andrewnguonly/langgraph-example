    "# How to stream messages from your graph\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple different streaming modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `values`: This streaming mode streams back values of the graph. This is the **full state of the graph** after each node is called.\n",
    "- `updates`: This streaming mode streams back updates to the graph. This is the **update to the state of the graph** after each node is called.\n",
    "- `messages`: This streaming mode streams back messages - both complete messages (at the end of a node) as well as **tokens** for any messages generated inside a node. This mode is primarily meant for powering chat applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers `streaming_mode=\"messages\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use this mode, the state of the graph you are interacting with MUST have a messages key that is a list of messages.\n",
    "Eg, the state should look something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypedDict, Annotated\n",
    "from langgraph.graph import add_messages\n",
    "from langchain_core.messages import AnyMessage\n",
    "\n",
    "class State(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "OR it should be an instance or subclass of `from langgraph.graph import MessageState` (`MessageState` is just a helper type hint equivalent to the above).\n",
    "\n",
    "With `stream_mode=\"messages\"` two things will be streamed back:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It outputs messages produced by any chat model called inside (unless tagged in a special way)\n",
    "- It outputs messages returned from nodes (to allow for nodes to return `ToolMessages` and the like"
